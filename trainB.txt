can't
get
enough
of
libidinous
young

dwellers

try
this
obscenely
bad
dark
comedy
,
so
crass
that
it
makes
edward
burns'
sidewalks
of
new
york
look
like
oscar
wilde
.

1
the
far
future
may
be
awesome
to
consider
,
but
from
period
detail
to
matters
of
the
heart
,
this
film
is
most
transporting
when
it
stays
put
in
the
past
.

1
[anderson]
uses
a
hit-or-miss
aesthetic
that
hits
often
enough
to
keep
the
film
entertaining
even
if
none
of
it
makes
a
lick
of
sense
.

1
if
you're
not
into
the
pokemon
franchise
,
this
fourth
animated
movie

years
won't
convert
you
--

even
keep
your

open

but
fans
should
have
fun
meeting
a
brand-new
pokemon
called
celebi
.

elvira
fans
could
hardly
ask

more
.

0
it's
push-the-limits
teen
comedy
,
the
type
written
by
people
who
can't
come
up
with
legitimate
funny
,
and
it's
used
so
extensively
that
good
bits
are
hopelessly
overshadowed
.

0
the
final
result
makes
for
adequate
entertainment
,
i
suppose
,
but
anyone
who
has
seen
chicago
on
stage
will
leave
the
theater
feeling
they've
watched
nothing
but
a
pale
imitation
of
the
real
deal
.

you
will

report

to
share
airtime
alongside
the

report

0
quite
frankly

i
can't

why
any
actor

would
ever
work

mcculloch

again

they
looked
at
how
this
movie
turned
out

0
maybe
it's
the
star
power
of

something
aboul

seems
,
well

contrived

1
all
right
,
so
it's
not
a
brilliant
piece
of
filmmaking
,

it
is
a
funny
(
sometimes
hilarious

comedy
with
a
deft
sense
of
humor
about
itself

a
playful
spirit

a
game
cast

as
